There are four datasets: 1) bank-additional-full.csv(changed to bank-marketting-data) with all examples (26874) and 20 inputs,very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014] 2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. 3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).
